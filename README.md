# GANs with Fashion MNIST Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using the Fashion MNIST dataset. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented via a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework.

## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, with 6,000 images per category. Each image is 28x28 pixels.

You can find more information about the Fashion MNIST dataset [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

## Getting Started

To train and test the GAN model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open `GANs.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred environment.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the GAN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Results

Generated images will be saved in the `results/generated_images` directory during training.
